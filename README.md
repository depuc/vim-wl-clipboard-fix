# üñãÔ∏è Vim Clipboard Fix for Wayland

This repo provides a simple workaround to fix Vim clipboard issues on **Wayland**.

If you're using Vim and find that `"+y` or `"+p` doesn't work (i.e., copying/pasting with the system clipboard does nothing), this solution bridges the gap using [`wl-copy`](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) and [`wl-paste`](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard).

‚úÖ No need for Vim with `+clipboard` support  
‚úÖ No need to switch to X11  
‚úÖ Works on any Wayland-based setup (GNOME, KDE, Sway, Hyprland, etc.)

---

## üîß What It Does

This setup maps new clipboard commands in Vim that use `wl-copy` and `wl-paste` behind the scenes to make clipboard operations work smoothly:

- Copy selected text from Vim to your system clipboard
- Paste clipboard content into Vim
- (Optional) Automatically copy all yanks to clipboard

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- A Wayland session
- `wl-clipboard` installed (`wl-copy`, `wl-paste`)
- Vim (even without `+clipboard`)

### üõ† Install `wl-clipboard`

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install wl-clipboard
```
```
# Arch
sudo pacman -S wl-clipboard
```

### üßæ Vim Clipboard Workaround Snippet

Add the following lines to your `~/.vimrc` (or source the `wayland-clipboard.vim` file in this repo):

```vim
" Yank selected text to system clipboard using wl-copy
vnoremap <leader>y :'<,'>w !wl-copy<CR><CR>

" Paste from system clipboard using wl-paste
nnoremap <leader>p :r !wl-paste<CR>

" Optional: Automatically copy any yank to system clipboard
augroup AutoCopyWL
  autocmd!
  autocmd TextYankPost * silent! call system('wl-copy', getreg('"'))
augroup END
